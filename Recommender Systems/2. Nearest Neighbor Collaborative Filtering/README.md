In this course, you will learn the fundamental techniques for making personalized recommendations through nearest-neighbor techniques. 
First you will learn user-user collaborative filtering, an algorithm that identifies other people with similar tastes to a target user and combines their ratings to make 
recommendations for that user. You will explore and implement variations of the user-user algorithm, and will explore the benefits and drawbacks of the general approach. 
Then you will learn the widely-practiced item-item collaborative filtering algorithm, which identifies global product associations from user ratings, but uses these product 
associations to provide personalized recommendations based on a user's own product ratings.
